- **Good (70-89)**: Solid answer covering key points
- **Average (50-69)**: Adequate answer with room for improvement
- **Below Average (30-49)**: Weak answer missing key elements
- **Poor (0-29)**: Inadequate or incorrect answer

## Performance Metrics

The system evaluates candidates across multiple dimensions:

- **Overall Performance**: Comprehensive score (0-100)
- **Communication Clarity**: How well the candidate communicates
- **Technical Depth**: Level of technical knowledge demonstrated
- **Problem Solving**: Ability to think through problems
- **Confidence Level**: Candidate's confidence and self-assurance

## Best Practices

### For Accurate Analysis

1. **Clear Audio Quality**: Ensure good audio quality for better transcription
2. **Specific Skills**: List specific, relevant skills for assessment
3. **Proper Context**: Provide accurate job role and company information
4. **Interview Structure**: Well-structured interviews yield better analysis

### Skill Input Examples

- **Technical**: "Python, JavaScript, React, SQL, AWS, Docker"
- **Soft Skills**: "Communication, Leadership, Problem Solving, Teamwork"
- **Domain-Specific**: "Machine Learning, Data Analysis, System Design"

## Limitations

- Currently optimized for English-language interviews
- Works best with structured interview formats
- Requires OpenAI API for comprehensive analysis features
- Analysis quality depends on audio quality and interview content

## Error Handling

The API includes comprehensive error handling:

- File format validation
- Transcript quality validation
- Skill count limits (max 20 skills)
- AI provider compatibility checks
- Structured response validation

## Security Considerations

- Files are processed temporarily and cleaned up automatically
- No permanent storage of audio/video files
- API keys should be secured and rotated regularly
- Consider rate limiting for production deployments

## Development

### Adding New Analysis Features

1. Define new Pydantic models in `main.py`
2. Create analysis functions using OpenAI structured responses
3. Update the response models to include new data
4. Add frontend components to display new insights

### Custom AI Prompts

The system uses carefully crafted prompts for each analysis type. You can customize these prompts in the respective functions to better suit your interview style or requirements.
